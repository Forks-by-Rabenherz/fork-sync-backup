# Fork Sync Backup

> Fork Sync Backup is a Bash script designed manage your forked repositories. The script automatically synchronizes forks with their upstream repositories, creates timestamped zip backups, prunes older backups, and updates each fork's description with the last sync time.

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Fork Synchronization:**  
  Detects the default branch for each fork and updates it by merging upstream changes.

- **Optional Change Detection:**  
  Control whether the script only backs up when new changes exist (or no backup exists) or always backs up.

- **Backup Retention:**  
  Automatically removes older backups, retaining only a specified number of the most recent backups.

- **Repository Description Update:**  
  Updates each fork's description with the last sync time.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository or download the `backup_forks.sh` script:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/fork-sync-backup.git
    cd fork-sync-backup
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Make sure `jq` and `curl` are installed on your system.

3. **Make the Script Executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x backup_forks.sh
    ```

## 🔑 Configuration

Open `backup_forks.sh` in your favorite text editor and configure the following variables at the top:

```bash
GITHUB_ORG="your_org_here"          # Your GitHub organization name
GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here"      # GitHub Personal Access Token with necessary permissions
BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/backup_dir"      # Local directory to store backup zip files
MAX_BACKUPS=30                      # Maximum number of backups to retain per repository
VERBOSE=false                       # Set to "true" for detailed output, "false" for minimal output
CHECK_FOR_CHANGES=true              # Set to "true" to only backup when new changes exist (or no backup exists), "false" to always backup.
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script to synchronize your forks, create backups, and update descriptions:

```bash
./backup_forks.sh
```

I recommend setting up a cron job to run the script automatically at regular intervals. For example, to run the script every day at 3 AM:

```bash
0 3 * * * /path/to/backup_forks.sh
```
